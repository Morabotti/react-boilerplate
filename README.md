# React Application Boilerplate

My variant of [Jubic's React Starter](https://github.com/jubicoy). This repository tries to keep up with latest versions of the dependencies. This repository also includes few design architectures.

This starter uses **Node v16** and **npm 8.1.0**. With older versions, you may need to delete `package-lock.json` before installing.

## Contents

This boilerplate is for React web applications that are written in Typescript. Code is using Babel and Webpack. For static code tests, we use typescript and eslint with [jubic-eslint-styles](https://github.com/jubicoy/eslint-config-jubic-typescript).

### Base structure:
* **React 17.*** with JSX Transform
* **Typescript 4.5.***
* **Webpack 5.***
* **Babel 7.***
* **Eslint 7.***

### UI packages:
* **@mui/material** & **@mui/lab** 5.* Material UI for packages for UI building.
* **notistack** for user friendly notifications.
* **mdi-material-ui** for icons. Alternatively you can use **@mui/icons**.

### API, Forms and Util packages:
* **formik** for user friendly forms & **yup** for form validation.
* **react-query** for handling and caching API calls.
* **moment** for date handling.
